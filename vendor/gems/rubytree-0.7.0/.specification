  RubyTree is a Ruby implementation of the generic tree data structure.  It provides a node-based model to store keyed
  node-elements in the tree and simple APIs to access, modify and traverse the structure.  RubyTree is node-centric, where
  individual nodes on the tree are the primary compositional and structural elements.
  
  This implementation also mixes in the Enumerable module to allow standard access to the tree as a collection.
